# Bike-Sales-Project
This Project gives an idea about the bike buyers vs non-bike buyers based on different verticals like gender, income, age, and region.

Key Insights:
Higher income individuals are more likely to purchase bikes, as seen in both gender groups.
Males consistently have higher average incomes than females, which could influence purchasing behavior.
